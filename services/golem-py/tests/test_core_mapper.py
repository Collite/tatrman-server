"""P4.1·T5 — the honest mapper, tested against the SERVER's own lattice goldens.

These fixtures are not copies. `tests/lattice_fixtures.py` reads
`services/resolver/src/test/resources/lattice/*.lattice.json` — the goldens the Kotlin
core is held to (RV-P2.1/P2.5) — and parses them as proto JSON. That makes this a
CROSS-LANGUAGE conformance check on one corpus (RV-28: one corpus, one core, N shells):
if the resolver changes what it emits, this suite fails on the same day the Kotlin one
does, and neither side can drift quietly.

The spike's caveat is what T5 exists to close. Its mapper reconstructed one mention per
BINDING because the door of the day reported only what it had bound — so `G1_UNBOUND`
was not expressible at all. `h2-cs` below has a mention with ZERO bindings and a typed
G1 gap on it; mapping it correctly is the whole point.
