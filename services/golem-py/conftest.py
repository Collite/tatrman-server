"""Ensure the generated proto stubs exist before test collection.

The `org.tatrman.*.v1` Python stubs live under `generated/` and are gitignored
(regenerated from the shared `.proto` source). Generating them here keeps
`uv run pytest` self-contained — the same bootstrap nlp uses.

⛑ TWO things here are load-bearing on a CLEAN checkout, and it took a red CI run to
find both. They pass forever on a dev machine, where the stubs were generated once.

1. **`gen_proto.py` ends in `raise SystemExit(main())`**, so `runpy.run_path(...,
   run_name="__main__")` raises `SystemExit` even on SUCCESS. Anything written after
   that call inside the same `try` never runs — which is why the invalidation below
   sits in a `finally`.
2. **pytest's `pythonpath` ini option puts `generated/` on `sys.path` BEFORE this
   conftest is imported.** On a clean checkout that directory does not exist yet, so
   CPython caches a null importer for it in `sys.path_importer_cache`, and creating the
   directory a moment later does NOT invalidate that cache. Every subsequent
   `from org.tatrman…` then fails with `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'org'` on
   a machine where the files are plainly there.

⚑ `services/nlp/conftest.py` has the same shape and therefore the same latent bug. It
has never been hit because nothing ever ran that suite in CI — see the `golem-py` job's
recon note in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
