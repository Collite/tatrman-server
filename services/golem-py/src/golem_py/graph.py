"""The RV-11 loop as a pydantic-graph.

Three framework facts this module is built on, all verified by inspection at the P0-3
spike and all still true at 2.22.0:

1. **No built-in persistence.** `pydantic_graph.persistence` does not exist and
   `Graph.run()` has no start-at-node argument. Resume is OURS: a `ResolutionState`
   snapshot plus a start step that routes on it. That is not a workaround — RV-11 says
   a resume rejoins `assess_gaps`, and a start step that dispatches on the pin says
   exactly that, in one readable place, where the RS-26 token contract can see it.
2. **⚑ `.to(a, b)` is a FAN-OUT, not a branch, and it fails SILENTLY** — every target
   runs. Every fork here is a `g.decision()`, and `tests/test_graph_shape.py` asserts
   it mechanically over the built graph rather than trusting review.
3. **A `@g.step` returns the plain value** wired to `g.end_node`; returning `End(x)`
   does NOT unwrap. Unwrapping happens in exactly one place: `run_turn()`.
