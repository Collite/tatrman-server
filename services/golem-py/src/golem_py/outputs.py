"""What a turn can END as. Three outcomes, and none of them is an error.

* `Ask` — the pause (RV-17). Carries the CORE's signed `resume_token` (RS-26) and OUR
  snapshot id, side by side and never merged: signing the option set agent-side would
  let the agent fabricate "the user chose X".
* `Answer` — a completed turn, with the lattice and any carried gap notes attached.
* `RefusalWithGaps` — the honest refusal (H4). "I understood you completely; I cannot
  do this." The lattice rides along, which is what makes it a refusal rather than a
  failure.
