/**
 * The upstream contracts the deterministic core consumes. Interfaces (not concrete stubs) so
 * the pipeline is testable with fakes — the Q-20 corpora feed the pipeline through these seams
 * without a live nlp/fuzzy. NONE is an LLM; NoLlmDependencyTest guards the module boundary.
 *
 * ⚑ **There are three now, and that is a deliberate change** (R1, ruled 2026-08-28). This KDoc
 * used to say "the only upstreams are nlp and lex-matcher" — an invariant worth updating
 * explicitly rather than quietly outgrowing. [GroundingClient] is the third, and it is the one
 * that carries the interesting caveat: a grounding kernel MAY be configured with an LLM
 * fallback of its own. The non-LLM guarantee this module makes is therefore about the resolver's
 * own dependencies, which `NoLlmDependencyTest` still checks; it is not a claim about what a
 * kernel does behind its wire. Estates that need the stronger guarantee run their kernels with
 * the fallback off (hartland does: `CHRONO_LLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED=false`), and that is a
 * DEPLOYMENT fact, not a code one — so it is stated here rather than asserted in a test that
 * could not see it anyway.

     * chose — scoped by target class, optionally overriding the authored method — about one span
     * it decided was worth asking about again.
     *
     * Defaulted to "no vocabulary answered" so a test double that never exercises rounds does not
     * have to implement it. [GrpcFuzzyClient] always overrides; a fake that returns this default
     * simply makes the loop a no-op, which is exactly what an estate with nothing to narrow does.
