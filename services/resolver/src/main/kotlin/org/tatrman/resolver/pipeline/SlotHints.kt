/**
 * MH T2 — the SYNTACTIC SLOT a proposed span sits in.
 *
 * The problem it exists for: one word, two objects. On hartland `prodejna` is the store
 * dimension's label AND a form of the Stores-channel term pinned to the sales fact, so the
 * Binder sees two unrelated identities in one tie band and — correctly, on the evidence it had —
 * refuses. But the sentence already says which one is wanted: you *count* things, you *group by*
 * things, and you *restrict a measure* by the thing being measured. Since MS the two candidates
 * differ in `objectKind`, so the slot's kind preference can break the tie
 * (`Binder.decide`, contracts §7.3).
 *
 * **Why the slot is computed here and not in the Binder** (architecture A3): `GateSpans.gate`
 * never sees the parse — `ResolverPipeline` hands it candidates only — and `ReGate` synthesises
 * candidates with `headToken = -1` for a span it is re-deciding. So the slot is stamped onto the
 * candidate in the pipeline, where the parse is in scope, and the Binder reads
 * `candidate.slot`. A re-gate therefore gets [SlotHint.NONE], which is structurally right: the
 * broad pass already slotted that span, and a re-decision with no parse must not invent one.
 *
 * The same signals `FrameRoles` (R3–R9) already trusts, read at the same tokens: the `case`
 * child's lemma, the head token's `deprel`, the `conj` sibling. What is new is only *when* they
 * are read — before binding instead of after it — and one table (`count-heads`) that had no
 * reader at all, because nothing in the system had ever looked at a count quantifier.
 *
 * ⚠ Under MH a mis-attached preposition costs a wrong OBJECT, where before it cost a wrong ROLE.
 * That is why the rule is a *preference* (✅MH-D2) that never empties the band, and why T3's
 * reachability check can veto it.
 *
 * Pure, deterministic, no I/O.
