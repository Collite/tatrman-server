/**
 * RV-P1.6.T6 (RV-42) — **which kernel owns which span**, as a lattice annotation.
 *
 * P1.6 gave every grounding kernel its own `ground:` slice of the compiled lexicon and taught it
 * to answer *"is this span mine?"* ([org.tatrman.grounding.lexicon.GroundingSlice]). What was
 * missing is the other half of that question: the core never said which kernel a span should be
 * offered to in the first place, so a caller either asked all three or guessed. A trigger
 * annotation is that narrowing, recorded where the ladder can read it.
 *
 * **It is evidence, never a binding decision.** A trigger says "chrono has vocabulary for this
 * word", which is a fact about the LEXICON; it says nothing about which model object the mention
 * binds. So it rides the same batch as everything else but in its own slots, and the gate — the
 * thing that decides bindings and clarifications — never sees it. Two consequences worth stating,
 * because both are load-bearing:
 *
 *  - *roce* binding `md.dimension.Calendar.year` **and** carrying `ground:chrono` is not an
 *    ambiguity to clarify. It is one span with two true annotations, which is exactly what a
 *    lattice is for; the compiler pins the same overlap rule from the authoring side (a term may
 *    be both an `op:` and a `ground:` target, no warning).
 *  - the trigger is appended AFTER the model bindings, so the top binding still speaks for the
 *    mention in frame-role derivation. A grounding trigger must not be able to move a SUBJECT.
 *
 * **One BatchMatch still.** The trigger queries are extra slots on the pass the core already
 * makes (B-T1: never per-span RPCs), not a second round trip. The P2.3 lookup rounds are where a
 * *narrowed re-query* belongs; this is the broad pass telling them where to start.
