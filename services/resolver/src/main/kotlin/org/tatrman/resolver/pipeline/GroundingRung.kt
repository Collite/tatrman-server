/**
 * ✅ **R1 (Bora, 2026-08-28) — the grounding rung.**
 *
 * A universal DATE span arrives from the NER layer typed but **inert**: `2025` carries a kind and
 * a surface string, and nothing that could restrict a query. Two facts are missing, and neither
 * can be recovered inside this service:
 *
 *  - **what interval it denotes** — generative in the kernel, which is why a pure-pattern span
 *    like `12.5.2024` grounds with zero lexicon entries;
 *  - **which column that interval applies to** — discovered from `meta.v1` semantic roles
 *    (`role: event_date`), and the resolver has no metadata client.
 *
 * The second is the one that matters. Without it the composed question carries a grain nothing
 * restricts by, and `TransDslQueryDoor` refuses — correctly, because the alternative is picking a
 * date column by guessing and answering a different question confidently.
 *
 * ## What this is NOT
 *
 * It is not a lexicon problem, and it is worth saying so because it is the natural first guess.
 * The grounding *trigger* vocabulary already reaches the lattice — `month` → `ground:chrono` has
 * bound all along ([GroundingTriggers]) — and the lib is explicit that it is *"a trigger
 * vocabulary, not an interpretation grammar"*. A trigger ANCHORS the kernel; it does not say what
 * the span means. And `2025` needs no trigger at all. No amount of vocabulary substitutes for the
 * kernel.
 *
 * ## Fail-open, on purpose
 *
 * Every failure path — rung off, no package, kernel down, deadline, `UNGROUNDABLE`, a non-ER
 * anchor — leaves the value exactly as it was and returns no entry for it. The lattice then is
 * the pre-R1 lattice, and the door refuses the way it did before. An optional rung that could
 * make a turn *worse* than not running would not be optional.

     * First it read `"er.entity.\${q.namespace}.\${q.name}"`, because the unit test's fake set
     * `namespace = "date_dim"` — the assumption the code was written from, restated as the input
     * that would confirm it. Against veles that produced `er.entity.entity.date_dim.cal_date`;
     * golem read the doubled segment as a SECOND entity and refused for want of a relation.
     *
     * The fix then guessed again — `namespace` was assumed to be `entity.<entity>`, since either
     * split explains the doubled string — and the new guard rejected the real `entity`, dropping
     * the attribution entirely and moving the refusal back to "nothing restricts by the grain".
     * A guard written from a guess rejects exactly the shape it was meant to admit.
     *
     * The shape above is now quoted from the wire, not derived from the symptom.

     * ⚑ **ER only.** A `DB`-coded anchor names a physical column, and an attribution is a
     * statement about the MODEL — mapping one to the other here would be inventing the er2db
