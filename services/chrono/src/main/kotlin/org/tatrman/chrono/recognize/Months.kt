 * Month-name recognition for cs + en. Czech is heavily inflected — a date says "15. května"
 * (genitive) and an adjective period says "květnové období" — so we match by the longest
 * diacritic-insensitive **stem** that uniquely identifies a month rather than an exact word.
 *
 * Order matters for the červen/červenec (June/July) pair: "červenec" must be tried before
 * "červen" because the latter is a prefix of the former. [ordered] encodes that.
