"""nlp front configuration.

RG-P1.S1: the front is **engine-free** — every model-bearing engine is an
HTTP-adapter client to a separate backend image (`url`), launched with an
**explicit model id** (`model`, S-1). Only `langid` (lingua) runs in-process.
Each backend declares its pinning `tier`: `SELF_HOSTED_PINNED` (in-cluster,
conformant) or `REMOTE_UNPINNED` (Lindat dev/eval — `RG-NLP-002`).

NLS-P3.2 adds the **lane** switch (NL-4) and the pack/list/pipeline sections
(contracts §7).

**What a lane is.** `default` is the lane a deployment can run anywhere: Stanza
and spaCy, permissively licensed, no UFAL images. `option` adds the UFAL stack
(MorphoDiTa, NameTag 3), whose licence is a per-deployment decision (NL-5). So
the lane is not a preference between engines that are all present — it decides
*which engines are there at all*, and that is why `base op_routing` IS the
default lane rather than a lane-neutral table with the lane picking favourites.

**`NER.cs` is the case the whole design turns on.** Stanza's Czech bundle has no
NER head, so in the default lane nothing can serve it. It is left out of the base
table on purpose, the request still runs every other phase, and the response
carries `NLS-NLP-011` saying so (NL-14: honest degrade, never a silent one).
