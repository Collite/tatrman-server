"""The current pack snapshot, and how it is replaced (NL-15).

One object owns the loaded state; everything else reads it. Two properties make
that worth a module of its own.

**A failed load does not stop the service.** `Analyze` and `BatchLemmatize` need
no packs at all, and they are what Themis, Echo and kantheon actually call. So a
boot with a broken pack tree serves those normally, reports `ready=false`, and
puts the diagnostics where an operator will find them —
`GetStatus.pack_state.diagnostics`. `RunPipeline` is the only thing that fails,
with `FAILED_PRECONDITION`, which is the truth: the request is fine and the server
is not ready for it. Crashing instead would take the working half of the service
down over a YAML typo and put the reason in logs nobody is reading yet.

**A reload either replaces everything or changes nothing.** `reload()` validates
into a *new* snapshot and only then swaps the reference. There is no window in
which half the packs are new: a request that started against the old snapshot
finishes against it, because it holds the object rather than looking it up step by
step. The lock serialises concurrent reloads; readers never take it, since
replacing one reference is atomic and the snapshots are immutable.

A refused reload is therefore not an error *state*. `applied=false` plus
`NLS-PACK-010` and the diagnostics is the whole outcome, and the service is
exactly as healthy as it was a moment before. `pack_state.diagnostics` stays
empty — contracts §2.4 reserves it for a failed *boot*, and rightly: it answers
"is the snapshot now serving sound?", which after a refusal is still yes. The
refusal goes to whoever asked for it, synchronously, and to the log at ERROR.
