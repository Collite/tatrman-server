"""Layer-file export, and the gate on it (contracts §7; NLS-P9.2 T2/T6).

*"DB works, files publish."* This module is the second half of that sentence.
What leaves the database is a `*.morph.yaml` layer file in exactly the shape
contracts §3 specifies — the same shape a hand-authored layer has, written by
the same renderer the importers use — so an exported layer is reviewable as a
diff, ownable by a world, and compilable by the same `ttr-morph compile` that
builds the published snapshot.

**The gate is one line and it is the point** (`store.exportable_entries`):
`verified` and above. An entry at `proposed` is a hypothesis and an entry at
`auto-validated` is a hypothesis the engine could not refute; neither is a fact
about Czech, and the artifact this feeds ships to every deployment.

**A corrected form makes a full-form entry.** If a reviewer edited a cell of the
generated table, the entry no longer *is* its pattern — writing it out as
`vzor: hrad` would mean the compiler regenerates the uncorrected paradigm and
raises `LM-MORPH-005`, or worse, silently ships the version the reviewer
rejected. So those export as `forms:` entries, carrying the rejected pattern in
the `vzor` field exactly as the importers do, which is what keeps the mismatch
visible instead of losing it.

**Retractions are written down, not merely absent.** A rejected entry leaves the
export by disappearing from it, and a diff of a two-thousand-line generated file
shows a removal that nobody can attribute. So the header carries the retraction
list: which lexemes went, and why they are not simply missing (LM-12's world
lane reads that header by hand).
