"""`NlpClient` — the async gRPC client for the `nlp` front (NL-16).

The wheel ships the client so that every consumer speaks the same one. There were
going to be at least three otherwise: `nlp-mcp`, the legacy `ai-platform` front,
and whatever wanted `RunPipeline` next — each with its own idea of a deadline and
its own proto-to-Python translation.

**Its value-add is `run_pipeline` returning a `Document`.** The rpc answers with an
`AnnotatedDocument`, which is a wire shape: nested `FeatureValue` oneofs, features
as dotted keys. A caller wants annotation sets it can iterate and features it can
compare, so the client runs `doc_from_proto` and hands back the same gatenlp
`Document` the service was holding. That is the whole reason not to let consumers
use the generated stub directly.

**Deadlines on every call, retries on none.** A deadline is this client's
business, because a caller that forgets one gets a hang rather than an error.
Retries are not: the policy depends on what the caller is doing — `nlp-mcp` has a
circuit breaker (EXAMPLES.md §5d), a batch job wants to retry for a long time, an
interactive request wants to fail now. A retry loop in here would be one more
thing to fight.
