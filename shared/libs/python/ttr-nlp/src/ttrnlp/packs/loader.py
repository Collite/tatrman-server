"""Sources -> one immutable snapshot, or nothing at all (NL-15).

**Fail-all-or-nothing.** A source tree with three good packs and one broken one
loads *nothing*. The alternative — load what parses, skip what does not — is
worse than it sounds: the service comes up looking healthy, answers most
questions, and silently cannot answer the ones the broken pack was for. Nobody
notices until a user does. So a single ERROR anywhere raises `LoadError` with
every diagnostic from every file, and the previously loaded snapshot (if any)
keeps serving untouched.

**One validation code path.** ``ttr-nlp validate`` on a laptop, the service's
boot load, and ``ReloadPacks`` in the cluster all run the functions in this
module. That is a design constraint, not a convenience: a pack author whose file
passes locally and fails in the cluster has no way to tell which of the two is
wrong, and the DFP model-validator wraps this rather than reimplementing it.
``validate.py`` is the collect-don't-raise face of the same code, and it collects
by *not* raising rather than by walking a second path.

**Reading is separated from judging.** ``gather_sources`` reads and compiles,
returning diagnostics alongside whatever it did manage to build; the two callers
then decide what to do about them. This is what lets the CLI report all six typos
in one run while the service refuses the whole snapshot on the first.

**What a source is.** A directory (globbed for ``**/*.pack.yaml`` and
``**/*.list.yaml``), a single file of either kind, or an ``http(s)`` URL naming
one file. The URL lane keeps ``httpx`` in the ``[http]`` extra and imports it
lazily, so the mandatory dependency set stays as small as ⚑NLS-D3 needs.

**Unreadable sources are diagnostics, not exceptions.** A packs directory that is
not there is nearly always a volume that failed to mount, and the service must
come up saying so — a crash loop puts the reason in logs nobody is reading yet,
and Analyze does not need packs to work. The CLI, whose sources come from a human
rather than from config, checks its own arguments first and exits 2 for a path
that does not exist (contracts §9); everything this module reports is exit 1.
