"""Diagnostics — the one shape everything reports failures in.

The CLI, the pack loader, the service's boot-time load and ``ReloadPacks`` all
emit these, and the proto ``PackDiagnostic`` (contracts §2.3) has exactly these
five fields. Keeping the dataclass field-for-field identical to the wire message
is deliberate: a pack author reading a CLI error and an operator reading a
``ReloadPacks`` response are looking at the same text, and neither has to
translate.

Codes are contracts §8:

===================  ===========================================================
``NLS-PACK-001``     the pack does not parse — schema violation, or a structural
                     rule the schema cannot express (``repeat.min > max``)
``NLS-PACK-002``     the pack parses but cannot compile — a type not in the
                     phase's ``input:``, an RHS reference to an unbound name, a
                     duplicated ``bind:``
``NLS-PACK-003``     a list file is invalid
``NLS-PACK-004``     a pipeline references a pack, phase or list that is not there
``NLS-PACK-005``     CLI ``--model`` only: a query id or parameter name the model
                     does not declare
``NLS-PACK-010``     a reload was refused; the previous snapshot still serves
===================  ===========================================================

Why 001 covers the model-validator failures too: from a pack author's side there
is no interesting difference between "the schema rejected this" and "the schema
could not express it, so the loader did" — both mean the file is malformed and
neither can be reached by a rule at runtime. 002 is genuinely different: the
file is well-formed and every error in it is about how the parts refer to each
other.
