"""``ttr-nlp`` — the command line (NL-15).

The command that matters is ``ttr-nlp validate``, and its whole point is that it
runs the *same* ``ttrnlp.packs.validate`` code path as the service boot and
``ReloadPacks``: a pack that validates on a laptop validates identically in the
cluster, and the DFP model-validator wraps this rather than reimplementing it.

Written with stdlib ``argparse`` and nothing else. A CLI framework would be a
mandatory dependency for every consumer that only wants the library, and this
surface is one subcommand and three options.

Exit codes (contracts §9)::

    0   no ERROR diagnostics — these sources would load
    1   validation errors — the diagnostics are the output
    2   usage or I/O failure — the command could not be run as asked

The 1/2 split is about *whose* mistake it is, and it is drawn here rather than
inside the shared path. A path that does not exist is this command's argument
being wrong (2); the same missing directory in the *service's* config is a
volume that failed to mount, which must come back as a diagnostic so the service
can serve NOT_READY and say why (see ``loader``'s docstring). One reader, two
audiences, and the difference is handled where the audience is known.
