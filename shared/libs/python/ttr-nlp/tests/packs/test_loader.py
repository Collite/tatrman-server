"""NLS-P2.2.T1/T2/T5 — fail-all-or-nothing, and the state id.

Two properties carry the whole design, and both are about what does *not* happen.

**Nothing loads if anything is wrong.** The test that matters here is not "a bad
pack raises" — it is that three good packs beside one bad one produce *no*
snapshot. Partial loading is the failure this posture exists to prevent: a
service that comes up healthy, answers most questions, and cannot answer the ones
the broken pack was for, with nobody the wiser until a user notices.

**A state id means what it says.** Same bytes ⇒ same id, any change ⇒ new id.
`ReloadPacks` reports the id, so an operator uses it to tell a reload that
changed something from one that did not; an id keyed on mtimes or a counter would
call a redeployed identical config map a new snapshot.
